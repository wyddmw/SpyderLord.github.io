## Comparision with R-CNN and SPPnet
　　The Region-based Convolutional Network method achieves excellent object detection accuracy by using a deep ConvNet to classify object proposals.There are several drawbacks with R-CNN:Training is complicated.When it comes to R-CNN,first of all,we have to fine-tune a ConvNet on object proposals using a log loss.Then we apply specific linear SVMs to abstract features,which act as object detectors,replacing the softmax classifier learnt by fine-tuning.In the third training stage,the bounding-box regressors are learned.What's more,training is quite expensive in space and time.The reason why R-CNN is slow is that it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal without sharing computation.
