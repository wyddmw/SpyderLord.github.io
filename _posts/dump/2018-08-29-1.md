## Brief Introduction
　　I was learning R-CNN network recently.After forking some repositories on github, I tried to make a clear comprehension of the paper, so I programed on my own with the help of forked repositories. It took me about two days to finish reading paper and programming this series of work. I have to admit this process helps me to have a deeper comprehension of the paper. I added some notes and annotations in the programe to make it more friendly to readers.<br>
　　I wrote down my learning notes on my blog.[https://spyderlord.github.io/R-CNN](https://spyderlord.github.io/R-CNN) If you are interested, I hope my blog can be helpful.
## About code
　　The proper order to run this programe is 
- Run AlexNet.py first:Train Alexnet based on a large-scale dataset 17-flowers which can be downloaded on [http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/).If you clone this repository, the dataset is included already in the folder 17flowers.
- Run fine_tune_RCNN.py next:According to paper, we pre-trained the network on a large auxiliary dataset which is ILSVRC the author used.Then we fine-tune the network on a small dataset.Aside from replacing the last classification layer with a randomly initialized (N+1)-way classification layer(where N is the number of object classes,plus 1 for background),the CNN architecture is unchanged.In this programe, the dataset we use for fine-tuning is preserved in folder 2flowers.
- Run RCNN_Out.py last: In this .py file we test our work with a specific image.The result will show you some rectangles after processing CNN.I don't apply bounding-box regression. I will add related work later.<br>
　　Here are some introdution for other significant files:
- config.py: Some const parameters like path .etc
- preprocessing_RCNN.py: Some functions for image processing like getting region proposals and resizing the input images.
- tools.py: Some functions for display.
## Environment
　　Tensorflow 1.8 + Ubuntu 17.10 + GTX1080 Ti 16G
## Related libs
　　tflearn+cv2+sklearn+numpy.etc
## Shortages
　　I didn't arrange the batch 64 for positive while 128 for negative according to the paper since the dataset I use is not large enough.
